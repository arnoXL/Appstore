# Appstore_Recommender_System
This is a project completed by me under the instruction of bittiger's staff.

This is a recommender System using MongoDB and Cosine Similarity, written in python 2.7.

1. To run this code, the two files "app_info.json" and "user_download_history.json" should be imported into MongoDB.

2. According to the program's hint, input correct command to calculate out the recommended apps for each app or each user.

3. The program will update the data in MongoDB automatically.
